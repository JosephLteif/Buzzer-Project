# Buzzer-Project
Arduino based wireless Buzzers network using many arduino nano

This is a project that was made for our startup, consisting of 80 arduino nano, each combined with an RFID chip to make a wireless buzzer connected to a main screen to display the number of the pressed buzzer. Can be used for a quiz game night, role playing games, donation events where each person that wants to donate can press the provided buzzer, and much more.
